# Definition Sheet For Project: 

<!-- For HTML -->

- Div: A div is a container in it's purest form. It's main purpose is for styling and grouping content. It has no form unless you give it form through CSS.

- Class: Allows elements to be specifically targeted when applying CSS (and JavaScript).

- Anchor Element (or a tag): This element creates a hyperlink that will direct your end user to the page that is designated. 

<!-- For CSS -->

* = universal selectors - This targets the entire page. 

- Margin: The space that's created around the element. 

- Padding: The space that's created within an element. 

- Box-Sizing: Calculates the total width and height of an element. (setting the box-sizing to "border-box" in the universal selector is the best way to layout elements).

- Display: Lets you know whether element is block or inline. Also deals with the flow layout. This property has a major on the flow of the layout of your project. (two types of display elements - "block" and "inline-block")

- Flex-Box: Allows you to layout items in any direction and gives the items the ability to "flex" their sizes. Gives you the ability to better manipulate your items.

- Flex: This is where you can determine whether an item will grow or shrink. 

- Justify-Content: This is how the browser distributes your items along the main-axis of a flex container. (the same applies for a grid container)

- Align-Items: responsible for the alignment of items on the y-axis when using flex.

- VH (or viewport height): Based on the height of the viewport. - 1vh is equal to 1%. 

- Z-index: sets order of elements. 

- Postion (Relative): Offset's itself based on the top, right, bottom, and left values. This positioning will not affect the position of any other elements. It is only offset relative to itself.

- Border-Radius: How we round the corners around a border's edges. 

- Object-Fit: Tell the browser how an element should fit in it's container. (There are many different values that can be used with this property. Values include: "contain", "fill", "none", etc.)

- Box-Shadow: Adds shadow around the outside of your elements. (Think of it like a drop shadow away from the frame of the element). It will also take the shape of the border that is around the element. The more common values that are used are called "length" values.

- rgba - Red, Blue, Green, and Alpha (alpha can be a number between 0 and 1 as well as a percentage). They can either be numbers or percentages ranging from 0 - 255 (and in percentages 0 - 100%). 

- Pseudo-class: It's a special that's added to an element. (example: "hover" - one of the more commonly used pseudo-classes).

- Transform: Allows you to rotate, scale, skew, and translate an element.

- Transition: Enables you to target and define the transition of two states of elements.
